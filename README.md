## How do I Gain this Magical Power?? ##
Fork! <br />
Clone! <br />
Execute! <br />

## How to Install ##
### In all seriousness ###
* Clone or Fork (then clone) the repo
* You can simply run the rainbow.sh program - it'll execute from there
* If you want to generate rainbows from anywhere in your system - i have a .bashrc install 
    * run install.sh - this script just appends the funcion 'rainbow' to your .bashrc file
* If you save the rainbow.sh script somewhere, you can add an alias like
    alias rainbow="$HOME/.rainbow
* Make sure to restart your teminal (or system?) so the .bashrc changes take effect
* After the reset - call 'rainbow' and (hopefully) your terminal will now be filled with colors so bright
* Everyone's system is different - so, these (should) work for most people using bash 
    * But, I can't gaurntee that it'll work for everyone - for sure make sure your .bashrc looks okay after execution
* Enjoy!
